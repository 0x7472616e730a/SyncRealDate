# SyncRealDate

## Short Description
SyncRealDate is a plugin that let you sync your Minecraft world daylight cycle with the one that you currently live on.
For Example : if you live in U.K. ( __EW__ ) , your Minecraft world daylight cycle is going to sync with the one in UK so it will be 2 A.M at ... 2 A.M. .

You can change your time zone so if you don't want to play like you were in U.K you can change to another time zone ( You can play as if you were in Poland except you live in Argentina).

You can also decide if you want to have a daylight saving or not (it will change your time by 1 hour , tbf I don't know why daylight saving is a thing in some countries).

## Installation

You just have to download the release of the version you want and you'll need to put the .jar file into your **plugins** folder.
it will create a "**timeproperties.props**" in the same folder.

## Commands

The first command you can use is :

```
/syncdate start/set/stop
```

- **/Syncdate start** will ... start the plugin if you have decided to stop it at some point or if it hasn't started by itself.

- **/Syncdate set** will only change the time once. it can be used if you think that the daylight cycle has an offset.

- **/Syncdate stop** will stop the plugin. 

The second command is :

```
/timezone
```

this one is really simple , it will open an In-game Window that will let you choose a timezone and if you want to have Daylight saving or not.
